ofxPd
===========

ofxPd is an addon for openFrameworks that embeds the Pure Data synthesis engine in an openFrameworks application.

It is based on [pdlib by Bryan Summersett](http://bsumm.net/projects/pdlib.html), also [available on GitHub](http://github.com/bryansum/pdlib), which in turn is based on [Pure Data](http://puredata.info) v0.42.5 by Miller Puckette et. al.

Due to the inclusion of the OSC and Networking externals for Pure Data by M. R. Peach (libs/mrpeach), ofxPd is released under the GNU GPL, which means that any application which uses this addon must also be released under the GPL. See LICENSE for details.
